## Installation

The simplest way to install this mod is by downloading it through the mod manager Thunderstore and then launching the game through Thunderstore's UI.

## Compatibility

This mod has been tested to work with version 45 of Lethal Company. It might not work in later or earlier versions as the vanilla sounds could have other names.
